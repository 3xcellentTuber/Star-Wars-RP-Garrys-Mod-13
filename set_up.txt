How you set this up:

1: go to my collection http://goo.gl/fI18Ma , add all of those addons onto your collection, its going to take a bit but its worth it.
2:start your server and let it download and install all of these addons.join your server, to check that it proparly installed all
after that, shut down your server.
3:copy the addons from the addons folder that I Provided you, to your addons folder.
4.replace your data folder with MINE.
5.replace YOUR gamemodes folder with mine as well.
6.replace the SV.db file that you have on your server with mine(this Data Base file has all the perma-prop data for the rp_stardestroyer_v1 map)
from here on, launch your server and you should be good to go.
if you want to whitelist people to certain jobs you type in the garrys-mod console: ulx adduser NameOfTheUser STPVT
this will add the user to the ulx group of stormtrooper private(all the ulx groups are included and are in the data folder, you do not need to create any groups atm).

Enjoy your new Impiral SWRP server!
as I already said, 
all of the copy rights belong to me and to my server's community, and you may not call it yours even after you made changes, due to this gamemode being written by FPtje, and overwritten by me. By you downloading this and using this project, you agree to the fact that the base code is FPtje's and that the overwritten one(darkrp mod') is mine. You are allowed to make changes(Localy).

This project is for people that already have thier server server configured and ready to go. I will be supporting this project, if there are any errors with the code that I had written, I will check it, you may contact me over my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/c/3xcellenttuberen I will not be fixing YOUR errors, if you created any changes over my code or FPtje's I do not guarantee that I will fix it for you.
